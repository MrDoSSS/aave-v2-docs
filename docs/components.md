# Core Components

## What and Why
The Aave v2 market is composed of modular contracts with narrowly scoped responsibilities. Understanding which contract handles which concern is crucial when auditing flows or designing integrations.

## Contract Catalogue

| Component | Contracts | Responsibilities | How It Fits in Flows |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| `LendingPool` (proxy + implementation) | `LendingPool.sol` | Handles end-user actions: deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, rate swap, flash loan, liquidation. Maintains reserve state and enforces validation logic. | Entry point for all user-triggered flows; updates reserve indexes before mint/burn operations. |
| `LendingPoolAddressesProvider` | `LendingPoolAddressesProvider.sol` | Registry for pool, configurator, oracle, lending-rate oracle, pool admin, emergency admin, collateral manager. | Governance/multisig updates these addresses; other contracts read them to locate canonical components. |
| `LendingPoolConfigurator` (proxy + implementation) | `LendingPoolConfigurator.sol` | Admin interface to list reserves, configure LTV/LT/bonus, toggle borrowing, deploy aTokens and debt tokens, upgrade implementations. | Called only by pool admin role after governance execution; its changes feed into future pool interactions. |
| `LendingPoolCollateralManager` | `LendingPoolCollateralManager.sol` | Executes liquidation mechanics via `delegatecall` from the pool, enforcing close factor and bonus application. | Invoked during `liquidationCall` flow to compute seized collateral and burn debt tokens. |
| `AToken` | `AToken.sol` (+ proxies per reserve) | Interest-bearing ERC-20 minted on deposit, burned on withdrawal. Stores reserve treasury address for protocol fee minting. | Receives mint/burn instructions from pool; scaled balances track depositor share. |
| `StableDebtToken` | `StableDebtToken.sol` (+ proxies per reserve) | Tracks principal and fixed borrow rate per user; supports rebalancing when utilisation is extreme. | Minted on stable borrow, burned on repay or liquidation; feeds health factor calculations. |
| `VariableDebtToken` | `VariableDebtToken.sol` (+ proxies per reserve) | Tracks scaled variable debt using borrow index. | Minted on variable borrow, burned on repay or liquidation. |
| Interest Rate Strategy | `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy.sol` (or custom) | Computes liquidity and borrow rates based on utilisation and slope parameters. | Queried by `LendingPool` whenever reserve state updates are required. |
| Price Oracles | `AaveOracle.sol` + Chainlink feeds | Provides asset prices in ETH; supports fallback oracle. | Used in health factor, liquidation eligibility, and borrowing power checks. |
| Flash Loan Adapters | `FlashLoanReceiverBase.sol` implementers | Provide hooks for integrations to use flash liquidity. | Called during flash loan operations; must repay plus premium within transaction. |
| DEX Swap Adapters (optional) | `UniswapLiquiditySwapAdapter`, `UniswapRepayAdapter`, `ParaSwapLiquiditySwapAdapter` | Route collateral or borrowed funds through Uniswap/ParaSwap during refinancing, repay, or liquidation helper flows. | Invoked via flash-loan callbacks; must settle flash debt back to the pool within transaction. |
| Incentives Controller (optional deployment) | `AaveIncentivesController` | Distributes liquidity mining rewards (e.g., stkAAVE) based on index accounting. | aTokens and debt tokens call `handleAction` to update reward state after user interactions. |

## Data Structures

- **`ReserveData`** (`DataTypes.sol`): stores configuration bitmask, liquidity/borrow indexes, current rates, token addresses, interest rate strategy, and an id. Updated on every state change.
- **`ReserveConfigurationMap`**: 256-bit packed structure encoding LTV, liquidation threshold, liquidation bonus, decimals, active/frozen flags, borrowing/stable toggles, and reserve factor.
- **`UserConfigurationMap`**: bitmask that tracks, per reserve, whether the user is using it as collateral and/or has an outstanding borrow.
- **Scaled Balances:** `AToken` and `VariableDebtToken` expose `scaledBalanceOf`. Multiply by the current index to derive real balance: `balance = scaledBalance * liquidityIndex / RAY`.

## How It Works
1. **Address Discovery:** Front ends and contracts query the addresses provider to locate the current pool, configurator, and oracles. Governance (or a multisig) is the provider owner and can swap implementations.
2. **Reserve Lifecycle:** When a new asset is listed, configurator deploys token proxies, initialises indexes to 1e27, sets risk parameters in the configuration map, and stores the interest rate strategy address in `ReserveData`.
3. **Runtime Operations:** Each user action enters the pool, which fetches the reserve state, validates conditions via `ValidationLogic`, updates indexes/rates via `ReserveLogic`, and calls token contracts to mint/burn as needed.
4. **Liquidations:** The pool delegates to the collateral manager to compute how much debt can be covered (fixed 50% close factor) and the collateral to seize with the liquidation bonus applied.
5. **Adapters:** Optional swap adapters receive flash liquidity, execute trades via external routers (Uniswap or ParaSwap), and return funds before the flash loan closesâ€”allowing users to deleverage or migrate positions atomically without native DEX support in the core pool.

All components are designed for composability: external applications can rely on proxy-address stability while upgrades are governed through the addresses provider ownership.***
